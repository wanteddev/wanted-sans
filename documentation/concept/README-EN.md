To naturally convey the voice embodied by Wanted, Wanted Sans is primarily designed in a geometric sans-serif form, aligned with the geometrically shaped Wanted logo.

## Form

However, typical geometric sans-serifs can sometimes convey a somewhat heavy and rigid atmosphere due to their strict adherence to form. In Wanted Sans, while the geometric structure remains foundational, the shapes are slightly opened up, aiming for a balance of readability and a humane appearance. Thus, Wanted Sans manages to exude a sense of humanity from its refined structure, oscillating between solemnity and liveliness, sometimes even with a playful twist. This characteristic is especially pronounced in letters and numbers like s, t, 2, and 8.

## Hangeul

The Hangeul characters are a variant of the [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans), resembling [Pretendard](https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard). However, in the ExtraBlack weight, a more experimental boldness is showcased.

## Intelligent Context Recognition

Wanted Sans intelligently discerns context. Thus, when it needs to display suitable characters with Hangeul, or when distinguishing character shapes within words, it automatically presents them in the most appropriate form.

## OpenType Features

With the OpenType feature support, Wanted Sans is adaptable in a variety of situations including standard scenarios, situations requiring enhanced readability, cases where uniform number width is needed, or moments demanding unique shapes.

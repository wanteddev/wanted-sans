Insight:
- Erbar Grotesk(1926)는 특징이 없고 읽기 쉬우며, 순수한 타이포그래피를 지향했다.
- Futura(1928)은 기하학적 조형 원리를 바탕으로 견고하면서도 읽기 쉬운 타이포그래피를 지향했다.
- Twentieth Century(1959)는 Futura를 견제하고자 Futura 대체 글꼴을 제작했다.
- Avenir(1988)은 20세기 초 건조한 지오메트릭 산세리프 형태에서 휴머니스트 스타일을 결합한 자연스러운 타이포그래피를 지향했다.
- Circular(2013)는 그동안의 지오메트릭 산세리프 형태를 바탕으로 자연스럽고 노련한 타이포그래피를 지향했다.
- Volte(2016)은 건조한 지오메트릭 산세리프 형태에서 모양을 열어 트렌디한 타이포그래피를 지향했다.
